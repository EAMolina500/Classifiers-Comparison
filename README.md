High-Dimensional Model Simulation Tool Overview

This repository contains a R script that implements a simulation tool designed to evaluate the performance of classification models in high-dimensional settings. The tool is developed as part of the undergraduate thesis titled "Multinomial Logistic Regression in High Dimensions".

Purpose

The core problem addressed by this project is the evaluation of classification algorithms when the number of predictors (features) is large compared to the sample size. High-dimensional datasets pose challenges to traditional methods, making it critical to assess their accuracy, robustness, and parameter recovery capabilities.

Features

The script provides:

- Synthetic Data Generation: Produces training and testing datasets with user-defined properties, including the number of features, sample size, and covariance structure.

- Model Evaluation: Implements multiple classification models: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) Penalized Regression models (LASSO and Elastic Net) Random Forest

- Metrics Calculation: Quantifies model performance using misclassification rates and parameter recovery metrics, such as precision and recall for penalized regression models.

- Simulation Control: Allows configuration of parameters for the simulation, including the number of iterations and dataset dimensions.

- Using the script:

1. Clone the repository,
2. Install the latest version of R available, download RStudio or some development environment for R,
3. Run the toy example set in the script,
4. Modify the set parameters (optional)

Load the script

'source("Simulate.R")'

Example for parameter definition:

'
x <- 10
Sigma <- matrix(0, x, x)
diag(Sigma) <- 1
nnull <- round(.3*x, 0)
beta1 <- c(rep(0, x-nnull), runif(nnull, -0.5, 0.5))
beta2 <- c(runif(nnull, -0.5, 0.5), rep(0, x-nnull))
'

Run the simulation

'
results <- Simulate(
  sigma = Sigma,
  beta.list = list(beta1, beta2),
  p = x,
  n.train = 150,
  n.test = 2000,
  R = 10
)
'

View the results

'print(results)'

Output The script outputs:

- Misclassification rates: mean and standard deviation for all models. - Precision and Recall: For LASSO and Elastic Net models.
- Metadata: Total time, number of attempts and successful iterations.

If you need to install a dependency, you can do so as follows:

Example: install the dependencies 'glmnet' and 'randomForest'

'install.packages(c("glmnet", "randomForest"))'
